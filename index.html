                                        She cares so much for her little babies, both biological and adopted. Her favorite thing is 
                                        definitely to chase birds out from bushes or trees and watch the chickens. Her athleticism
                                         definitely shines through while she does these activities. Also sheâ€™s quite the flashy golden 
                                         who is also quite picky with what she chooses to eat. We love our beautiful Mandi! ðŸ’™</p>
